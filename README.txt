2D parallel finite element solver for the Boltzmann-BGK equation implemented in FORTRAN90.

Fluid solver capable of handling high Knudsen number flows across a range of Mach, Reynolds and length scales.

Written by Dr Ben Evans and Dr Michele Meseti, Swansea University.

Main code is spectralBGK.f90
