## General principles to use in getting rid of master-slave pattern ##
######################################################################

1. Each array of the kind *_PP is duplicated on the master, with a *_PP_CP
allocated (and deallocated when necessary).
2. IG = 1 is the new master.
3. In MPI calls, all ranks must be now IG-1 instead of IG. Broadcast from 
master are still from rank 0.
4. now MPI_SIZE_P is the number of partitions. NGRPS = MPI_SIZE_P and not 
MPI_SIZE_P-1 anymore.

- PTMESH

- GETLOC
    a lot of places where the master-slave pattern was used.
    
- EDGCOM 
    no real master-slave patter is used. only to shift shift rank numbers
    to match partition numbers.

- INICON2 (and INICON)
    Only used broadcasts. code is invariant, except that we need to 
    remove the IF(MPI_RANK_P.NE.0) in a place only.
   
- ADVNCE
   removing MPI_COMM_SLAVES and the like 
   removing the IF(MPI_RANK_P.NE.0) in several place.

- EDGFLXOPT 
   MPI_COMM_SLAVES -> MPI_COMM_P
   SLAVERANK removed (was not used)

- GETMAC
   temporary arrays *_PP_CP had to be allocated on master in order to 
   separate between the arrays received from the other ranks and the array
   owned by the master itself.

- GTEQNF 
   nothing to do, rank is useless, removed

# Runtime errors found on the phi #
###################################

- Still MPI_SIZE_P-1 was present in many places in the code
- Some of the new arrays *_PP_CP were declared as INTEGERS instead of REAL
- MPI_Recv called on the master when the max DTE was to be determined. Unnecessary.

On 2 processes:
- issues in GETLOC. Probably error in the way ELGRP(1,i) is set up (+-1 on rank).
  - ACTUALLY NO: the problem was that ELGRP was not initialized correctly. It was initialized
  in PTMESH up to index NELEM_PP even for the part of the second partition while it must be 
  initialized for NELEM_PP_CP element per partition (NELEM_PP is now only referred to the
  rank 0 which is doing all the work in initialization.
  - Deadlocks caused by tag misalignment (tag = MPI_RANK_P*10 instead of (MPI_RANK_P+1)*10)
    This issue was present in some places. Also, I got confused between sends - IPCOM_PP is
    sent many times from slaves to master, and a deadlock was present because I didn't
    understand the correct match between sends from the ranks and receives on the master.
  - *_PP_CP arrays deallocated after first iteration of the cycles, but needed also on the
    other iterations.
    the right 
  - IPCOM_PP was used on the master in several places where IPCOM_PP_CP would have been the 
    right choice.
  - copying arrays must be done specifying the portion, otherwise also the borders of the 
    array will be modified. (*this must actually be checked if it's a problem or not)



- issues in GETMAC:
  - NPOIN_PP was used instead of NPOIN_PP_CP.
  - An IF statement was missing - sends must not be performed if on the master rank/partition 1
  - a MPI_RANK_P.EQ.IG instead of (MPI_RANK_P+1).EG.IG was present
  - copying arrays must be done specifying the portion, otherwise also the borders of the 
    array will be modified. (*this must actually be checked if it's a problem or not)

- issues in FLUCON2
  - It seems that an edge is not found. The problem actually lied in the assignments in GETLOC.
